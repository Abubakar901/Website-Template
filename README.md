# Website Template

This is a Dummy Website Template, It's a website I was given for project.
It's made in HTML/CSS. I have used different components in html and different css properties for each box. It is also a responsive website, all the code is written in pure CSS.

In HTML, I have used navbar for navigation, section and div container. There are some images used as img tag and some as background image.

In CSS, I have created 2 different Files, style.css and phone.css, In style.css
The website page of maximum width is written and in phone.css, the only responsive 
properties are written.
